# Data Science Portfolio
My name is Thariq, I am a computer science fresh graduate from the University of Indonesia. I have a keen interest in data because I believe how important their role is in a decision-making process. I aspire to create ML models that will bring impact that matters on people's lives in the near future.

This repository of notebook is created to be my personal knowledge base as well as to demonstrate my skills & knowledge to potential recruiter. It contains various data science projects for solving classification problems, regression problems, clustering problems, etc. I would also be very pleased if you would take a moment to check out my other repository of AI project for my undergraduate thesis here.
